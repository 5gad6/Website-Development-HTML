            <h3><center>LIPOMAS</center></h3>
<p>Lipomas, like soft tissue sarcomas, grow under the skin, however they are soft fatty lumps which are benign. They are harmless and do not usually need 
any treatment. Although lipomas are benign, it is important to get any lumps checked. They may appear on the <i>shoulders, chest, bottom, thighs, arms,</i> on 
the <i>back</i> and sometimes on the <i>forehead.</i> <br>Lipomas are very common and appear mostly between the ages of 40 and 60, however they can develop at any age, even 
at birth. They affect people of all genders but are more common in women than in men. Lipomas rarely grow on muscles, internal organs or the brain.  

<h3>Symptoms of Lipomas </h3>
Below are some symptoms that may alert you to a lipoma, however, many people with lipomas do not usually 
notice any symptoms.
<ul>
  <li>They feel soft and squishy.</li> 
  <li>They can be anything from the size of a pea to a few centimeters across.</li> 
  <li>They may move slightly under the skin when touched.</li> 
  <li>They are usually painless.</li> 
  <li>They have a slow growth rate.</li> 
  <li>They can appear anywhere on the body.</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Causes of Lipomas</h3> 
<p>The exact causes of lipomas are not known, however an individual is more likely to develop a lipoma if someone in the family has it, as it can be passed 
down through families (hereditary).</p>

<p>Some conditions known to cause lipomas include; </p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Dercum’s disease,</b> also known as adiposis dolorosa or Anders’ syndrome is a rare disorder that causes painful lipomas to grow, most often on 
   the arms, legs and trunk.</li> 
   <li><b>Gardner syndrome</b> is a form of a disorder called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) that causes lipomas and a range of health problems such as 
   colorectal cancer and dental abnormalities.</li> 
   <li><b>Hereditary multiple lipomatosis</b>, also called familial multiple lipomatosis, is an inherited disorder (passed down through families).</li> 
   <li><b>Madelung’s disease,</b> also called multiple symmetric lipomatosis, is a condition that occurs most often in men who drink alcohol excessively, 
   causing lipomas to grow around the neck and shoulders. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Lipomas</h3> 
<p>All lipomas are made of fat and only some contain blood vessels or other tissues. Some types of lipomas include; </p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Angiolipoma</b> is a type of lipoma that contains fat and blood vessels and is often painful.</li> 
   <li><b>Conventional lipoma</b> is the most common type of lipoma, containing white fat cells which store energy.</li> 
   <li><b>Fibrolipoma</b> is mainly made up of fat and fibrous tissues.</li> 
   <li><b>Hibernoma</b> is a type of lipoma containing brown fat whereas most other lipomas contain white fat. Brown fat cells generate heat and help regulate 
    body temperature.</li> 
   <li><b>Myelolipoma</b> is a type of lipoma containing fat and tissues that produce blood cells.</li> 
   <li><b>Spindle cell</b> is another type of lipoma that contains fat cells which are longer than they are wide.</li> 
   <li><b>Pleomorphic</b> lipomas have fat cells of various shapes and sizes. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Management and Treatment</h3> 
<p>Whereas lipomas are harmless and usually not painful, they can be uncomfortable if they press against a nerve or develop near a joint. Most lipomas do not 
need to be removed, however if they cause, pain or discomfort, they can be surgically removed. As an alternative to lipoma removal surgery, liposuction may
be recommended where a thin needle is used to remove fatty tissue from the growth.</p>   

<h3>Prevention</h3> 
<p>Since lipomas are usually inherited from family, there are no preventive measures. To reduce the risk of developing Madelung's disease, a condition that 
causes lipomas to grow, limit the amount of alcohol intake.</p>

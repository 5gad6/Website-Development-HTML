            <h3><center>BONE SARCOMAS</center></h3>
      Bone sarcoma, also known as <b>bone cancer,</b> can affect any bone in the body, but in most cases, it develops in the long bones of the legs or upper arms. 
Primary bone cancer is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer caused by <a href="Metastasis.html">metastasis</a>. The main symptoms of bone cancer 
consistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night, inflammation over the bone which if near a joint can make movements difficult, 
a noticeable lump over a bone, and weak bones that break more easily compared to normal bones. Some other symptoms of bone sarcoma include unexplained weight loss, high temperature and sweating particularly at night. 

<h3>Types of Bone Cancer</h3>
<ol>
   <b><li><i>Osteosarcoma</b></i> - the most common type of bone sarcoma, affecting children and young adults under the age of 20.</li> 
   <b><li><i>Ewing Sarcoma</b></i> – mostly affecting people between the ages of 10 and 20.</li> 
   <b><li><i>Chondrosarcoma</b></i> – mostly affects adults over the age of 60.</li>
</ol>
 
<h3>Causes of Bone Sarcoma</h3> 
In most cases, the causes of bone cancer are not known, however, circumstances that predispose a person to this type of cancer are: 
<ul>
   <li>Having had exposure to radiation during radiotherapy.</li> 
   <li>Having a condition known as Paget’s Disease (most people with this condition, however, do not develop bone cancer)</li> 
   <li>Having genetic conditions such as <i>Li-Frumeni syndrome.</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>Treatment</h3> 
The treatment of bone sarcoma depends on what type of bone sarcoma it is, how much it has developed and how far it may have spread. Some treatment 
options include: 
<ul>
   <li>Surgery to remove the cancerous bone, which is often possible to reconstruct or replace, however, amputation may sometimes necessary.</li> 
   <li>Chemotherapy.</li> 
   <li>Radiotherapy.</li>

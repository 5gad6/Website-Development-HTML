            <h3><center>WHAT IS CANCER?</center></h3>

<p>Normally, human cells grow and multiply, through a process called cell division, to form new cells as the body needs them.
Cancer is a disease in which some of these cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>When cells grow old or become damaged and die, cell division occurs to replace the dead cells. This orderly process sometimes 
breaks down and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells form tumors, which are lumps of body tissue,
that can be <b><i>malignant</i></b> (cancerous) or <b><i>benign</i></b> (not cancerous).</p>
<p>Cancerous tumors spread and invade into nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors. For example, cancer 
can spread from the breast to the brain and from the brain to the lungs. This is a process called <b><i>metastasis.</i></b>
<p><b>Cancers mostly form solid tumors, however cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.</b></p>
<p>Benign tumors do not spread into or invade nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors don’t usually grow back,
whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors are sometimes quite large and can cause serious symptoms and can be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.
</p> 

<h3>Differences Between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Cancer cells <b><i>grow</i></b> when and where they are not needed whereas normal cells only grow when and where they are needed.</li>
   <li>Cancer cells <b><i>invade</i></b> nearby areas and spread into other areas of the body whereas most normal cells do not move around the body and stop growing 
   when they encounter other cells.</li>
   <li>Cancer cells <b><i>trick</i></b> the immune system to protect it instead of attacking it and helps it stay alive and grow.</li>
   <li>Cancer cells <b><i>accumulate</i></b> multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplicating and erasing chromosome parts.</li>
   <li>Cancer cells <b><i>rely</i></b> on different kinds of nutrients in an abnormal way than most normal cells to create energy and grow more quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cancer cells are mostly mainly dependent on these abnormal behaviors that  they cannot survive without them, therefore, researchers have taken advantage of this fact,
 developing therapies that target these abnormal features. <b>For example,</b> some cancer therapies prevent blood vessels from growing towards the tumors,
 essentially depriving it of the needed nutrients for growth.</p>

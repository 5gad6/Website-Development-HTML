            <h3><center>CARCINOMAS</center></h3>
<p><b>Epithelial tissue</b> lines most of the organs, the internal passageways in the body like the oesophagus, and the skin. <b>Carcinoma</b> is cancer
that forms in epithelial tissue. Most cancers affecting your skin, breasts, kidney, liver, lungs, pancreas, prostate gland, head and neck are carcinomas.
Carcinoma is the most common form of cancer, making up <b><i>80%</i> to <i>90%</i></b> of cancer diagnoses. 
</p>

<h3>Classifications of Cancer</h3> 
<p><b>Classification of Cancer by Tissue Type</b><br> 
Cancers are classified based on the type of tissues the cancer originates from. <b>Cancer classifications by 
tissue type include;</b></p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Carcinoma</b> starts in epithelial tissue. </li>
   </li><b>Sarcoma</b> starts in connective and supportive tissue. For example muscle, bone, and cartilage. </li>
   <li><b>Myeloma</b> starts in plasma cells that are inside bone marrow.</li>
   <li><b>Leukemia</b> starts in the bone marrow, where blood cells are made. </li>
   <li><b>Lymphoma </b>starts in the lymphatic system. For example lymph nodes and spleen. </li>
   <li><b>Cancer can also start in more than one type of tissue in the body</b> </li>
</ul> 

<p><b>Classification of Cancer by Distribution</b> <br>
Carcinoma can be classified by how the cancer grows and spreads.As carcinoma cells grow and multiply, they 
form solid masses called tumors. Cancer cells can break away from tumors and spread to other parts of your body 
(metastasize). Labels for carcinoma describe how much it has spread.</p> 

<ul>
   <li><b>Carcinoma in situ</b> is carcinoma that has not spread.</li> 
   <li><b>Invasive carcinoma</b> is carcinoma that has spread to surrounding tissue close to where it formed.</li> 
   <li><b>Metastatic carcinoma</b> is carcinoma that has spread to other parts of your body. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Carcinomas</h3> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Adenocarcinoma</b> starts in the glandular epithelial cells, which are the glands that line the organs. 
  Most prostate cancers, breast cancers, colorectal cancers and pancreatic cancers are adenocarcinoma.</li>  
   <ul><li><b>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)</b> is a type of adenocarcinoma responsible for 85% of all kidney cancers.</li>
   <li><b>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</b> is an adenocarcinoma and the most common form of liver cancer.</li></ul>
<br>
  <li><b>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)</b> starts in the basal cell layer of the top layer of skin, the epidermis. A layer 
  of basal cells lines the bottom of the epidermis which replaces the cells in the top layer of your epidermis 
  (squamous cells) when they die. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. </li>
 <br> 
  <li><b> Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)</b> starts in the top layer of the epidermis, also known as squamous cell 
  layer. It usually appears in those parts of your skin that receive the most sun exposure, like your face, ears, 
  neck, arms, and legs. Squamous cell carcinoma can also form in the mucous membranes lining your lungs, 
  esophagus, head and neck and is the second most common type of skin cancer, which generally spreads faster than 
  basal cell carcinoma.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</b> starts in your breast milk ducts. Being "in situ" means that the 
  carcinoma hasn't spread to cells outside the milk ducts. Ductal carcinoma in situ is considered noninvasive or 
  pre-invasive breast cancer and is highly treatable.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)</b> starts in your breast milk ducts, like ductal carcinoma in situ, 
  however, unlike DCIS, invasive ductal carcinoma may spread to nearby<br> tissue. If left untreated, it has the 
  potential of spreading to other parts of your body via your lymphatic system and bloodstream. Invasive ductal 
  carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer. </li>

<h3>Who is at Risk of Developing Carcinoma?</h3> 
Certain factors that may influence a person’s likelihood of developing carcinomas are as follows;
<ul>
  <li><b>Age:</b> Carcinomas are rare in children but not in adults 65 years or older.</li> 
  <li><b>Sex:</b> Except for carcinomas affecting the breasts, carcinoma risk is higher among men.</li> 
  <li><b>Race/Ethnicity:</b> Race-related risks vary by carcinoma type. Members of the black race are at  
  greater risk of certain adenocarcinomas, like lung cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. People of 
  Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at the greatest risk of colon cancer. White people, or people with less melanin, 
  are at greater risk of developing carcinomas related to skin. </li>
</ul> 

<h3>Causes of Carcinomas </h3>
<p>Carcinoma, like all cancers, begins when a genetic mutation or change transforms a normal, healthy cell into a 
cancer cell that keeps multiplying and making more cancer cells. Untreated, the cancer cells can invade nearby 
healthy tissue and may travel through your bloodstream or lymphatic system to invade other parts of your body (metastasize). The exact causes of the 
mutation that leads to the development of cancer cells are not known, 
however, certain factors may increase a person’s risk of developing cancer. </p>

<h3>Risk Factors</h3> 
Risk factors may vary, depending on the specific type of carcinoma.
<ol>
  <li><b>Adenocarcinoma</b></li> 
  <p>Risk factors for adenocarcinoma are significantly varied since this type of carcinoma can be present in 
  multiple organs, including the breast, prostate, pancreas, esophagus, colon/rectum, stomach, and lungs. <br><b>Some 
  common risk factors include:</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Tobacco use.</li>
      <li>Drinking alcohol.</li> 
      <li>Exposure to harmful toxins.</li> 
      <li>Previous radiation therapy.</li> 
      <li>Genetic mutations such as Breast Cancer (BRCA), Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), and 
      Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).</li> 
      </ul>
<br>
   <li><b>Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinomas</b> </li>
<br>
       <ul>
        <li>Excessive exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds.</li> 
        <li>Light-colored skin that burns or freckles easily.</li> 
        <li>Blue or green eyes, blonde or red hair.</li> 
        <li>An infection with a high-risk strain of HPV. </li>
        <li>Previous radiation therapy.</li> 
        <li>Exposure to harmful toxins.</li> 
       </ul>
<br>
   <li><b>Ductal Carcinomas (In Situ and Invasive)</b></li>
<br>
       <ul>
        <li>Family history of breast cancer (especially in relatives under 50). </li>
        <li>Genetic mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.</li> 
        <li>A high body mass index (in the overweight range or higher).</li> 
        <li>Never being pregnant or advanced maternal age.</li> 
        <li>Getting your first period at a young age.</li> 
        <li>Previous radiation therapy.</li> 
        <li>Late menopause.</li> 
       </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Stages of Carcinoma</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Stage 0</b> cancer is cancer that has not spread beyond where it formed and is often curable with prompt treatment.</li>
  <li><b>Stage 1</b> cancer is where the tumour is more pronounced than in stage 0, however, the cancer cells have not 
  spread to nearby tissues, organs or lymph nodes.</li> 
  <li><b>Stage 2</b> cancer is where the tumour is bigger than in the previous stage and may or may not have spread
  to the lymph nodes and surrounding tissues.</li>  
  <li>In <b>Stage 3</b> cancer, the tumour gets larger, and the cancer cells spread to surrounding tissues and 
  lymph nodes.</li> 
  <li><b>Stage 4</b> means the cancer cells have spread to other organs and/or parts of the body.</li> 
  <li><b>End stage</b> cancer refers to cancer that cannot be cured and is terminal.</li>  
</ul>

<h3>Management and Treatment</h3>
<p>Carcinoma treatment depends on various factors, such as the overall health of the patient, stage of the tumor, 
details of the biopsy report such as pathology, age and the expected outcome of the treatment.<br> <br>

Cancer cells or tumors may be removed for the safety of nearby healthy tissues. <b>Surgery</b> may be recommended 
if the carcinoma is confined to one area, that is, it has not metastasized.
<br><br>
Drugs may be given to kill cancer cells or prevent them from multiplying. <b>Chemotherapy</b> may accompany other 
treatments, like surgery or radiation. It may be used before surgery to shrink cancer cells so that they are 
easier to remove (neoadjuvant chemotherapy). It may be used afterward to prevent cancer cells from returning 
(adjuvant chemotherapy).
<br><br>
<b>Radiation</b> uses targeted energy beams, like X-rays, to kill cancer cells or prevent them from multiplying. It is 
often used in combination with surgery and chemotherapy. Like chemotherapy, radiation therapy can be used to 
shrink a tumor before surgery or to kill remaining cancer cells afterward. Radiation can also help relieve 
symptoms depending on the type of carcinoma.    
<br><br>
<b>Targeted therapy</b> uses drugs that target specific weaknesses or genetic changes in cancer cells. This treatment 
can zero in on these weaknesses, killing the cancer cells or stopping them from multiplying. 
<br><br>
<b>Immunotherapy</b> helps your immune system identify cancer cells and eliminate them. Immunotherapy may be 
recommended alongside other treatments, like chemotherapy.
<br><br>
<b>Hormone therapy</b> can lessen the impacts of hormones on cancer growth. Reducing the amounts of certain sex hormones 
circulating in your body can slow carcinoma growth. For example, long-term exposure to estrogen has been linked 
to an increased risk of breast cancer and exposure to androgens has been linked to an increased risk of prostate 
cancer.</p> 
<p>Depending on your diagnosis, treatment may be <b><i>curative, palliative or both.</i></b> The goal of curative treatment is 
complete cancer remission, which means that the signs and symptoms of the cancer are no longer present, while 
palliative care can help you manage cancer symptoms. It can also empower you to feel more comfortable and 
confident with care decisions as you navigate life with a cancer diagnosis.</p>
